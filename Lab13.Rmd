Hi Professor! I changed the theme for Lab 12. Learning RStudio was definitely a challenge for me since I had no prior experience in coding, but I found it to be very interesting! I'm going to try to continue it on my own once the semester ends. 


I'm not sure what else to write, but I hope you're having a great day, and have a relaxing winter break! :)
